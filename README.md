|Sync Incidents|Deprecated. This job synchronizes Google SecOps Alerts and Microsoft Sentinel Incidents. It ensures that comments, status, and tags are kept in sync between the two systems. For the job to identify the correct information, the Google SecOps case must have the “Microsoft Sentinel Incident” tag. If the alert didn’t originate from “Microsoft Azure Sentinel Incident Connector v2”,  you will need to add an “Incident_ID” context value to the case for the job to be able to find the correct information.|
